                Before the first shots were fired at the battles of Lexington and Concord,
                American colonists and British imperialists had already begun to fight on
                the ideological front. American and British pamphleteers struggled to determine
                the meaning of the revolution and the consequences of victory or defeat. 
                Ultimately, their words would define what it meant to be an American. 
                Fighting Words Online features videos of 41 dramatic readings, texts, and 
                images from the original pamphlets from the 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.utah.edu/collections/rare-books.php">University of Utah's rare book collections</a>.
                Viewers learn about the origins, conflicts, and ultimate 
                conclusions of the American Revolution from the words of the people who
                fought it â€“ listening to and reading contemporary printings of the works 
                of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, William Pitt, and others.
