  “A very strange Notion is now industriously spreading, that ‘till the late unhappy Stamp-Act, there were no Bickering and Discontents, no Heartburnings and Jealousies subsisting between the Colonies and the Mother Country. It seems ’till that fatal Period, all was Harmony, Peace, and Love. Now it is scarcely possible even for the most superficial Observer, if his Knowledge extends beyond the Limits of a Newspaper, not to know, That this is entirely false.” – Tract IV, The true interest of Great-Britain set forth in regard to the colonies; and the only means of living in peace and harmony with them
