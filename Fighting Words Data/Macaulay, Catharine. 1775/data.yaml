  “The anxious desire of preserving that harmony which had so long and so happily subsisted between the Parent State and her Colonies, occasioned the American to bear, with an almost blameable patience, the innovations which were continually made on their liberty, ’till the ministry, who imagined their moderation proceeded from ignorance and cowardice, by depriving them of almost every part of their rights which remained unviolated, have raised a spirit beyond the Atlantic, which may either recover the opportunities we have lost of restoring the breaches which for near a century have been making in our constitution, or of sinking us into the lowest abyss if national misery.”
