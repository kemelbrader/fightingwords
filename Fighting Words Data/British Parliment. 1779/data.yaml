  “The consequences of this man’s unaccountably weak and wretched conduct are, thirty thousand brave men destroyed, thirty millions of money expended; thirteen provinces lost; and a war with the House of Bourbon.
 
  If such misconduct is to pass without censure or punishment, there must be a radical weakness, either in the constitution of the state, or in the minds of the people, and the total dissolution of this empire must be fast approaching: for the people who sit in patient stupidity, and see themselves become the victims of ignorance or treachery, cannot, and do not deserve to exist as a nation.”
