  “The Colonies claim the Privilege, which is common to all British Subjects, of being taxed only with their own consent given by their Representatives, and all the Advocates for the Stamp Act admit this Claim. Whether, therefore, upon the whole Matter, the Imposition of the Stamp Duties is a proper Exercise of Constitutional Authority, or not, depends upon the single Question, Whether the Commons of Great Britain are virtually the Representatives of the Commons of America, or not.” – August 1765
