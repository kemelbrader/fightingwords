  “Where are now the two or three hundred thousand men, that we were told would pour down upon us? But what if they did? What would a million do, if they ran away, as soon as the English appeared? Whatever they do, they will not fight. I believe they can- cannot; for the hand of God is upon them. But they can rob, and plunder, and destroy, and turn a well-peopled and fruitful land into a wilderness. They can burn houses, and drive men, women, and children into the wild woods, in the depths of winter. Yea, they can burn whole towns, without any regard to the sick or aged, that necessarily perish in the flame. But did not God regard them? Did not their dying cries enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth?
 
  Such is the present state of affairs in America.”
