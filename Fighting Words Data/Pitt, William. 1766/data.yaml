  “There is an idea in some, that the colonies are virtually represented in this house. I would fain know by whom an American is represented here? Is he represented by any knight of the shire, in any county in this kingdom? – The idea of a virtual representation of America in this house, is the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of a man – It does not deserve a serious refutation” – January 1766, William Pitt

  “Protection and obedience are reciprocal. Great Britain protects America; America is bound to yield obedience.  If not, tell me where the Americans were emancipated? When they want the protection of this kingdom, they are always very ready to ask it. That protection has always been afforded them in the most full and ample manner. The nation has run itself into an immense debt to give them their protection; and now they are called upon to contribute a small share towards the public expence, an expence arising from themselves, they renounce your authority, insult your officers, and break out, I might almost say, into open rebellion... Ungrateful people of America!” – Mr. Granville in response
