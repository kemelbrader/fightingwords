  “Upon the Whole, I beg leave to tell the House what is my real Opinion: It is that the S--p A-- be repealed absolutely, totally and immediately. That the Reason of the Repeal be assigned, because it is founded upon erroneous Principles; at the same Time let the sovereign Authority of this Country over the Colonies be asserted in as strong Terms as can be advised – and be made to extend to every Point of Legislation whatsoever: That we may bind their Trade, confine their Manufactures, and exercise every Power whatsoever, except that of taking their Money out of their Pocket without their Consents.” – 17 December 1765
