  “Thus a bad state of health caused by debauchery, specially warns the suffering person of the necessity of temperance in the indulgence of appetite. And the miseries of civil war, whether incurred by immoderate stretches of power on the one side, or produced by a wanton abuse of liberty on the other, are loud and particular calls to the correction to these enormities.
 
  If this be a just representation, no christian can reasonably doubt that our present distressful and threatening circumstances in regard to America, ought to be thus viewed by every British subject on both sides of the Atlantic.” – 12 December 1776
