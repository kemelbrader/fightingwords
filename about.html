                In the summer of 2012 the exhibition <em>Fighting Words: American Revolutionary War Pamphlets</em> featured 41 pamphlets from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.utah.edu/collections/rare-books.php">University of Utah's rare book collections</a>. The exhibition chronicled the war from both sides of the Atlantic, using direct quotes from first editions by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, William Pitt, and others.

                This website transforms the physical exhibition into a collaborative, multimedia, online exhibition.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 41 videos are the result of a collaboration between Alison Conner, University of Utah Rare Books Curator; Sarah Shippobotham, Associate Professor and Head of the Actor Training Program; 11 students from the Theater department; and 2 students from the Film and Media Arts department at the University of Utah. The readings were filmed over two days in the J. Willard Marriott libraryâ€™s film studio. This location facilitated the use of the original pamphlets in the videos.

                This project would not have been possible without the support of Luise Poulton, Managing Curator of Rare Books, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lib.utah.edu/">J. Willard Marriott Library, University of Utah</a>.
